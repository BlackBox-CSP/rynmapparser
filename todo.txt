recursiveness level on get_tag_info()
wildcard tag matches
multiple tags in same request
need to be able to gather multiple identical tags. i.e. <address> and <address> (maybe try making all the dictionary values in to lists?)
break the dotted path stuff in to separate dictionaries.

10.42.52.240.address.os.osmatch.name 
dictionaryname[address][os][osmatch][name] = [name1, name2, name3]

list members of dictionaryname[address] returns os, address, etc
