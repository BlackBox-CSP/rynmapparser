recursiveness level on get_tag_info()
wildcard tag matches

need to be able to gather multiple identical tags. i.e. <address> and <address> (maybe try making all the dictionary values in to lists?)
break the dotted path stuff in to separate dictionaries.

10.42.52.240.address.os.osmatch.name 
dictionaryname[address][os][osmatch][name] = [name1, name2, name3]

list members of dictionaryname[address] returns os, address, etc

make it so csv only has one row of multiple tags by default. Right now if I run the os tag recursively I get a ton of rows with different os matches for the same host. 

clean up the clunky code that prepends the columns at the end of the run. it should probably be added as a method that's in the class.

completed:
multiple tags in same request
